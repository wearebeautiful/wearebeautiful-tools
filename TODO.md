    0001-[bodypart]-[pose]-bundle.zip

    Possible bodyparts:

     - body
     - bust
     - breast
     - nipple
     - vulva
     - buttocks
     - penis

     Poses:

     - normal (men - standing, women - laying), aroused, variant
     - variant name: _________________

2. metadata layers:

    a. Sacrocant (on paper, under lock and key): model release form, model identity
    b. private (copyrighted, european database protected, only accessible to researchers): ethnicity 
    c. public metadata (cc0): everything else in manifest.json  

3. Add bodypart/pose disambiguation page:

     https://wearebeautiful.info/browse/0004

   Lists all the available variants for model 0004

4. Generate model number
